## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites
-   You must have [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed on your machine.
-   You must have a code editor like VS Code or Android Studio with the Flutter plugin installed.
-   You must have a Google account to create a Firebase project.

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-directory>
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Run the following command in your project's root directory to install all the required packages.
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Firebase Setup
This project requires a Firebase backend. Follow these steps carefully.

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:**
    -   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    -   Click on "Add project" and follow the on-screen instructions to create a new project.

2.  **Register Your App:**
    -   Inside your new project, click the `</>` (web), iOS, or Android icon to register your app. You'll need to provide a package name (for Android, e.g., `com.example.ems_system`) or a bundle ID (for iOS).
    -   Follow the setup steps. For Android, you will download a `google-services.json` file. For iOS, you will download a `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.

3.  **Place Firebase Config Files:**
    -   **Android:** Place the downloaded `google-services.json` file in the `android/app/` directory.
    -   **iOS:** Place the downloaded `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the `ios/Runner/` directory using Xcode.

4.  **Enable Authentication Methods:**
    -   In the Firebase Console, go to **Authentication** (in the Build section).
    -   Click on the "Sign-in method" tab.
    -   Enable **Email/Password**.
    -   Enable **Google**. You may need to provide a support email.

5.  **Set Up Cloud Firestore:**
    -   In the Firebase Console, go to **Firestore Database** (in the Build section).
    -   Click "Create database".
    -   Start in **Test mode** for initial development (this allows open read/write access). **Remember to set up security rules before going to production!**
    -   Choose a server location.

6.  **Create the 'Employee' Collection:**
    -   Once your database is created, click on **"+ Start collection"**.
    -   Set the Collection ID to `Employee`.
    -   Add your first document with the following fields to match the `employee_model.dart`:
        -   `name` (string)
        -   `role` (string)
        -   `department` (string)
        -   `email` (string)
        -   `phone` (string)
        -   `joining_date` (timestamp)

### 5. Run the App
You are now ready to run the app. Connect a device or start an emulator/simulator and run:
```bash
flutter run
```
